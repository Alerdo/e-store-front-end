1-Fix the isAuthenticated Function
2- req.user is not assiging value apperantly, so check the pssport.js , the problem should be there 

First Problem 

Add to cart 

Expected on db 
cart_id , product_id , quantity
Check the router:


CORS setup 


Certainly, here are some key points you can note down for solving similar problems in the future:

Backend: CORS & Session Setup
CORS: Make sure you configure CORS correctly in your backend. If your frontend is running on http://localhost:3000, then your CORS setup can specifically allow this origin.

javascript
Copy code
const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
};
app.use(cors(corsOptions));
Session: Use express-session for handling sessions, and make sure to enable the cookie settings appropriately. If you're running on HTTPS in production, make the cookie secure.

javascript
Copy code
app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'your-secret-key',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      secure: false, // Set to true if using HTTPS
      maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
    },
  })
);
Passport: In your Passport setup, ensure that serialization and deserialization of the user are done correctly.

javascript
Copy code
passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
  done(null, user.id);
});
passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {
  // Fetch user by ID
  done(null, user);
});
Frontend: Fetch/Axios Request Setup
Credentials: When making fetch or Axios requests, make sure to include credentials. This is crucial for cookies to be sent and received across origins.

javascript
Copy code
fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include', // Important
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
Content-Type: Always set the Content-Type header to application/json when sending JSON data.

Debugging
Logs: Console logs are your friend. Insert log statements at key points to track the flow of data.
HTTP Status Codes: Make use of meaningful HTTP status codes in your API responses to easily identify the type of error.
Save these key points and refer back to them when you encounter similar issues in the future.
